<p><em>Sensitivity</em> (<abbr>s</abbr>) specifies the magnitude of plateau change that may result in an anomaly event. Suggested range of <abbr>s</abbr> is 2 to 4. In the static plateau detector type (<abbr>SPD</abbr>), <abbr>s</abbr> is set to a default value of 2. In the adaptive plateau detector type (<abbr>APD</abbr>), <abbr>s</abbr> value automatically varies based on the time series measurement data characteristics.</p>
