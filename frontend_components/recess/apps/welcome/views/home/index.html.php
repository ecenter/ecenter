<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>If you're seeing this message that means you've successfully installed Recess. <strong>Now for the fun part: building apps</strong>!</p>
<p>I appreciate your interest in the <strong><a href="http://www.recessframework.org/">Recess Framework</a></strong>! I hope you'll find this preview release (mostly) functional and (a lot) fun. As you are checking out the framework and building apps stay plugged in at <a href="http://www.recessframework.org/">RecessFramework.org</a>.</p>
<p>Recess ships with an application called '<strong><a href="<?php echo $_ENV['url.base']; ?>recess/">Recess Tools</a></strong>'. This app is designed to help you kick off your new application and maintain a 'global' sense of your projects. <a href="recess/">Check it out.</a></p>
<p>This is the first <strong>Public Preview Release</strong> so expect some rough edges and <a href="http://recess.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19507-recess-framework/overview">report the bugs that bite</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks! Let me know how it goes for you,</strong></p>
