The E-Center RESTful Query API
David Eads, 2010

The goal of this query API is to create a loose coupling between data
aggregation and analysis services written for the Energy Science Net
E-center project, and any client which may wish to draw on the data
(including the E-Center front-end user interface itself).

See http://code.google.com/p/ecenter/wiki/DataRetrievalServiceprotocol for the
latest specification of the query API.

Requires the patch from http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7231
