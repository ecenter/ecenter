jqPlot API Integration module
=============================

This module provides an API to integrate the wonderful jqPlot 
(http://jqplot.com) charting library with Drupal 6. It provides options for
directly providing the module with series data, for referencing data stored
in a global Javascript variable, and for drawing series data from HTML tables
on the HTML page.

jqPlot was developed by David Eads for the US Department of Energy E-Center
project (https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/ecenter/).

This module requires the jQuery Update module 
(http://drupal.org/projects/jquery_update) and has an optional dependency on
the Libraries module (http://drupal.org/project/libraries).


Installation and dependencies
-----------------------------

You must download jqPlot (https://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/downloads/).
If you are using the Libraries module, the jqPlot library may be placed in 
sites/all/libraries/jqplot or sites/sitename/libraries/jqplot. Other

jqPlot module has been tested to work with jqPlot 0.9.7r635 and the current 
(as of Feb 15, 2011) development versions.

jQuery 1.4+ is "required for certain" features of jqPlot. jQuery Update's
jQuery 1.3.2 should be sufficient for most uses of jqPlot, but has not been 
tested. If you are interested in running jQuery 1.4+, please see
http://echodittolabs.org/blog/2010/08/drupal-6x-jquery-142-new-possibilities and
http://drupal.org/node/685060.
