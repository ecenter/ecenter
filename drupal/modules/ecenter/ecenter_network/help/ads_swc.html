<p><em>Summary Window Count</em> (<code>swc</code>) is the number of recent measurements samples to be stored into the “summary buffer”; mean value of the measurement samples in swc is characterized as the network health norm for the path. Suggested range of swc is 21 to 50. In SPD, swc is set to a default value of 21. In APD, swc value is dependent on the sampling resolution, and as a rule-of-thumb based on empirical observations, swc=~2% of sampling resolutioni.</p>
