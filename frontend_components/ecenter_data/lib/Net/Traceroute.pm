# Description:  Perl traceroute module for performing traceroute(1)
#		functionality.

# Currently attempts to parse the output of the system traceroute command,
# which it expects will behave like the standard LBL traceroute program.
# If it doesn't, (Windows, HPUX come to mind) you lose.
#

# Could eventually be broken into several classes that know how to
# deal with various traceroutes; could attempt to auto-recognize the
# particular traceroute and parse it.
#
# Has a couple of random useful hooks for child classes to override.

=head1 NAME

Net::Traceroute - traceroute(1) functionality in perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Traceroute;
    $tr = Net::Traceroute->new(host => "life.ai.mit.edu");
    if($tr->found) {
	my $hops = $tr->hops;
	if($hops > 1) {
	    print "Router was " .
		$tr->hop_query_host($tr->hops - 1, 0) . "\n";
	}
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a parser for various traceroute
implementations.  At present, it can parse most LBL traceroute
derivatives used on typical unixes, and the traceroute of cisco IOS.
Traceroutes known not to be supported include that of Microsoft
Windows and HP-UX.

This module has two basic modes of operation, one, where it will run
traceroute for you, and the other where you provide text from
previously runing traceroute to parse.

=head1 OVERVIEW

A new Net::Traceroute object must be created with the I<new> method.
Depending on exactly how the constructor is invoked, it may perform
some tracing and/or parsing actions immediately, or it may return a
"template" object that can be used to set parameters for several
subsequent traceroutes.

Methods are available for accessing information about a given
traceroute attempt.  There are also methods that view/modify the
options that are passed to the object's constructor.

To trace a route, UDP packets are sent with a small TTL (time-to-live)
field in an attempt to get intervening routers to generate ICMP
TIME_EXCEEDED messages.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR AND CLONING

    $obj = Net::Traceroute->new([base_port	=> $base_port,]
				[debug		=> $debuglvl,]
				[max_ttl	=> $max_ttl,]
				[host		=> $host,]
				[text		=> $text,]
				[queries	=> $queries,]
				[query_timeout	=> $query_timeout,]
				[timeout	=> $timeout,]
				[source_address	=> $srcaddr,]
				[packetlen	=> $packetlen,]
				[trace_program	=> $program,]
				[no_fragment	=> $nofrag,]
				[use_icmp	=> $useicmp,]);
    $frob = $obj->clone([options]);

This is the constructor for a new Net::Traceroute object.  If given
C<host>, it will immediately perform the traceroute.  If given C<text>,
it will parse that text as traceroute output.

Given an existing Net::Traceroute object $obj as a template, you can
call $obj->clone() with the usual constructor parameters.  The same
rules apply about defining host; that is, traceroute will be run if it
is defined, or text will be parsed.  You can always pass
C<host => undef, text => undef> to clone.

Possible options are:

B<host> - A host to traceroute to.  If you don't set this, you get a
Traceroute object with no traceroute data in it.  The module always
uses IP addresses internally and will attempt to lookup host names via
inet_aton.

B<text> - Output from a previously run traceroute.  If set, and host
isn't, the given text will be parsed.

B<base_port> - Base port number to use for the UDP queries.
Traceroute assumes that nothing is listening to port C<base_port> to
C<base_port + (nhops - 1)>
where nhops is the number of hops required to reach the destination
address.  Default is what the system traceroute uses (normally 33434).
C<Traceroute>'s C<-p> option.

B<debuglvl> - A number indicating how verbose debug information should
be.  Please include debug=>9 output in bug reports.

B<max_ttl> - Maximum number of hops to try before giving up.  Default
is what the system traceroute uses (normally 30).  C<Traceroute>'s
C<-m> option.

B<queries> - Number of times to send a query for a given hop.
Defaults to whatever the system traceroute uses (3 for most
traceroutes).  C<Traceroute>'s C<-q> option.

B<query_timeout> - How many seconds to wait for a response to each
query sent.  Uses the system traceroute's default value of 5 if
unspecified.  C<Traceroute>'s C<-w> option.

B<timeout> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the traceroute to
complete.  If not specified, the traceroute will not return until the
host has been reached, or traceroute counts to infinity (C<max_ttl> *
C<queries> * C<query_timeout>).  Note that this option is implemented
by Net::Traceroute, not the underlying traceroute command.

B<source_address> - Select the source address that traceroute wil use.

B<packetlen> - Length of packets to use.  Traceroute tries to make the
IP packet exactly this long.

B<trace_program> - Name of the traceroute program.  Defaults to traceroute.
You can pass traceroute6 to do IPv6 traceroutes.

B<no_fragment> - Set the IP don't fragment bit.  Some traceroute
programs will perform path mtu discovery with this option.

B<use_icmp> - Request that traceroute perform probes with ICMP echo
packets, rather than UDP.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item traceroute

Run system traceroute, and parse the results.  Will fill in the rest
of the object for informational queries.

=item parse

Parse the previously provided C<text>, filling in the rest of the
object for queries.

=back

=head2 Controlling traceroute invocation

Each of these methods return the current value of the option specified
by the corresponding constructor option.  They will set the object's
instance variable to the given value if one is provided.

Changing an instance variable will only affect newly performed
traceroutes.  Setting a different value on a traceroute object that
has already performed a trace has no effect.

See the constructor documentation for information about methods that
aren't documented here.

=over 4

=item base_port([PORT])

=item max_ttl([PORT])

=item queries([QUERIES])

=item query_timeout([TIMEOUT])

=item host([HOST])

=item text([TEXT])

=item timeout([TIMEOUT])

=item source_address([SRC])

=item packetlen([LEN])

=item trace_program([PROGRAM])

=item no_fragment([PROGRAM])

=back

=head2 Obtaining information about a Trace

These methods return information about a traceroute that has already
been performed.

Any of the methods in this section that return a count of something or
want an I<N>th type count to identify something employ one based
counting.

=over 4

=item stat

Returns the status of a given traceroute object.  One of
TRACEROUTE_OK, TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT, or TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN (each defined
as an integer).  TRACEROUTE_OK will only be returned if the host was
actually reachable.

=item found

Attempt to return 1 if the host was found, undef otherwise.  This test
is a poor heuristic, and will frequently give wrong answers.

=item pathmtu

If your traceroute supports MTU discovery, this method will return the
MTU in some circumstances.  You must set no_fragment, and must use a
packetlen larger than the path mtu for this to be set.

=item hops

Returns the number of hops that it took to reach the host.

=item hop_queries(HOP)

Returns the number of queries that were sent for a given hop.  This
should normally be the same for every query.

=item hop_query_stat(HOP, QUERY)

Return the status of the given HOP's QUERY.  The return status can be
one of the following (each of these is actually an integer constant
function defined in Net::Traceroute's export list):

QUERY can be zero, in which case the first succesful query will be
returned.

=over 4

=item TRACEROUTE_OK

Reached the host, no problems.

=item TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT

This query timed out.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN

Your guess is as good as mine.  Shouldn't happen too often.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NET

This hop returned an ICMP Network Unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_HOST

This hop returned an ICMP Host Unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_PROTO

This hop returned an ICMP Protocol unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_PORT

Use in cisco and traceroute6 parsing.  In cisco, "!U", in traceroute6,
a "!".

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_ADDR

This hop returned an ICMP6 address unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG

Indicates that you can't reach this host without fragmenting your
packet further.  Shouldn't happen in regular use.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_SRCFAIL

A source routed packet was rejected for some reason.  Shouldn't happen.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB

A firewall or similar device has decreed that your traffic is
disallowed by administrative action.  Suspect sheer, raving paranoia.

=item TRACEROUTE_BSDBUG

The destination machine appears to exhibit the 4.[23]BSD time exceeded
bug.

=item TRACEROUTE_SOURCE_QUENCH

Some machine has generated an ICMP Source Quench message, asking you
to slow down.

=item TRACEROUTE_INTERRUPTED

"User interrupted test".  Cisco's traceroute does this.  Its unclear
how to produce it.

=back

=item hop_query_host(HOP, QUERY)

Return the dotted quad IP address of the host that responded to HOP's
QUERY.

QUERY can be zero, in which case the first succesful query will be
returned.

=item hop_query_time(HOP, QUERY)

Return the round trip time associated with the given HOP's query.  If
your system's traceroute supports fractional second timing, so
will Net::Traceroute.

QUERY can be zero, in which case the first succesful query will be
returned.

=back

=head1 CLONING SUPPORT BEFORE 1.04

Net::Traceroute Versions before 1.04 used new to clone objects.  This
has been deprecated in favor of the clone() method.

If you have code of the form:

 my $template = Net::Traceroute->new();
 my $tr = $template->new(host => "localhost");

You need to change the $template->new to $template->clone.

This behavior was changed because it interfered with subclassing.

=head1 BUGS

Net::Traceroute parses the output of the system traceroute command.
As such, it may not work on your system.  Support for more traceroute
outputs (e.g. Windows, HPUX) could be done, although currently the
code assumes there is "One true traceroute".

The actual functionality of traceroute could also be implemented
natively in perl or linked in from a C library.

Versions prior to 1.04 had some interface issues for subclassing.
These issues have been addressed, but required a public interface
change.  If you were relying on the behavior of new to clone existing
objects, your code needs to be fixed.
