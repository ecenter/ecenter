This is the root directory of the custom Drupal modules, themes, and other 
supporting files (patches, makefile, other assets) for E-center.

A full build system and install profile are planned for year 2.

First, use Drush Make to build the base Drupal installation:

# drush make /path/to/ecenter.make /path/to/target

Currently, to install the Drupal component of E-Center, you must copy or symlink
the modules and theme folders to /path/to/target/sites/default or 
/path/to/target/sites/mysite
